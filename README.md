# 👋 Hi, I’m Atharv Awle

🧑🏻‍💻 Final-year **Information Technology engineering student** at **Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology**  
🚀 Aspiring **AI Engineer**

I enjoy building things that *actually work* — not just demos or assignments.

My interests sit at the intersection of **software engineering, machine learning, and system design**. I like understanding how things work end-to-end: writing clean code, structuring data, designing logic, and gradually turning ideas into reliable, usable systems.

Over time, I’ve worked across **full-stack development, backend logic, databases, and ML-based systems**, and I’m now deliberately focusing on **AI-driven software engineering** — where models, code, and real-world constraints meet.

Right now, I’m sharpening my fundamentals, building deeper technical projects, and preparing for **full-time roles where learning fast and taking ownership actually matters**.

## 🔍 What I’m Currently Focused On

- Strengthening **AI/ML fundamentals** and applied model building  
- Writing **clean, scalable backend code**  
- Improving **data structures, algorithms, and system thinking**  
- Building projects that are **useful, not just impressive**
